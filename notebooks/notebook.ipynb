    "\n",
    "There are two main custom classes:\n",
    "- `VectorStore` manages vector operations and database interactions using a **Timescale** database with the **pgvector** extension. It stores high-dimensional embeddings for places and queries, enabling fast and accurate semantic search within **PostgreSQL**. \n",
    "- `Synthesizer` service for generating natural language responses based on user query. It takes the retrieved context (most relevant places) and crafts a coherent, context-aware answer, optionally providing a thought process and reasoning steps.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The data was collected from the Google Places API, and vectors were created from reviews, place types, and other relevant information to enable rich semantic search and recommendations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Typical use cases include food and places recommendations, context-aware responses, and advanced filtering based on metadata or predicates."
